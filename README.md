# ExamPortal-SpringMVC

# Description

This project, built using the Spring MVC framework, consists of two modules: Admin and Student. The Admin module is responsible for performing various operations such as creating, updating, and deleting exams, as well as managing exam-related information. The Admin can also manage student information, including adding, updating, and deleting student records, along with their report cards. Additionally, the Admin can generate reports for individual students as well as consolidated reports for all students, organized by exam.

The Student module allows students to log in using their student ID and password, which are provided by the Admin. Once logged in, students can access the exams assigned to them and take the exams. After completing an exam, the student's report card will be displayed.

This project has been developed using the Spring MVC framework, which is a widely used Java-based framework for building web applications. Spring MVC follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, providing a structured approach to developing web applications.

The project leverages Spring MVC's features such as controllers, views, and models to handle requests, render views, and manage data. It utilizes Spring's dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC) container to promote modularity, testability, and maintainability. The project also incorporates Spring Security for handling authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access the Admin and Student modules.

With its robustness, scalability, and ease of integration with other Spring modules and libraries, this Spring MVC-based project offers a reliable and efficient solution for managing exams and student information in an educational setting. The clean and well-structured codebase, along with comprehensive documentation, makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend the project according to specific requirements.
